This project uses SableCC 3.7 for code generation.

Before running the regeneration script, you must download SableCC 3.7:
- Download from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sablecc/files/sablecc/3.7/
- Place the JAR file as:
    lib/sablecc.jar

If you have just cloned the repository, you may need to make the script executable:
  chmod +x regenerate_sable.sh

The grammar specification is located at:
  src/main/resources/org/linguate/arboratecompiler/arborate_specification.txt

To regenerate the lexer/parser and supporting code, run:
  ./regenerate_sable.sh

This will:
- Delete the generated folders (analysis, lexer, node, parser)
- Delete old lexer.dat and parser.dat from resources
- Run SableCC to regenerate code
- Move the new .dat files to the correct resource locations
