This file contains information about using SableCC for code generation.

The grammar specification is now located at:
  src/main/resources/org/linguate/arboratecompiler/arborate_specification.txt

To regenerate the lexer/parser and supporting code, run:
  ./regenerate_sable.sh

This will:
- Delete the generated folders (analysis, lexer, node, parser)
- Delete old lexer.dat and parser.dat from resources
- Run SableCC to regenerate code
- Move the new .dat files to the correct resource locations

SableCC JAR should be placed in:
  lib/sablecc.jar
